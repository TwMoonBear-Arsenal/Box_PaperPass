壹、目的: 
一、未來運用構想：
I've prepared a vulnerable Ubuntu that with weak ssh password and cp-privilege vulnerabilities. I need a python test script.
二、擬請ChatGPT提供：
please provide a python script to test following functions.

貳、需求:
一、測試個案-管理設定
  * connect the ssh service in port 9527 with  uid/pwd:boxadmin/boxadmin, the result should show that boxadmin is in sudo group.。
一、測試個案-外部滲透
  * connect the ssh service in port 9527 with  uid/pwd:allen/allen, the result should show login attempt fail.
  * connect the ssh service in port 9527 with  uid/pwd:allen/password, the result should show login attempt success.
  * read ~/user.txt, the result should show file access success.。
二、測試個案-內部提權
  * connect the ssh service in port 9527 with  uid/pwd:allen/password, the result should show login attempt success.
  * use cp-previlege escallation tech to get root authority then read root.txt in root home directory,  the result should show file access success. 
參、ChatGPT回復格式:
一、注意事項：
  *  Please use PyTest for test work.
  * do the work step by step.make it easy to understand for students.
  * provide limited echo lines with traditional Chinese I show you in following reference.
  * Each Python function should contains detailed docstrings including the following:
    1. A brief description of what the function does.
    2. Detailed descriptions of the parameters, including their types.
    3. The return value type and what it represents.
    4. Any exceptions the function might raise.
    5. An example of how to use the function in a docstring comment."
二、回復範例：
  import pytest
  import ...

# 測試個案1
  @pytest.fixture(params=["hello", "pytest", "12345", "空字符串"])
  def string_fixture(request):
      """測試個案1：提供多個測試用例"""
      return request.param

# 測試個案2
  def test_reverse_string(string, expected):
      """測試個案2：測試字符串反轉功能"""
      assert reverse_string(string) == expected, "字符串反轉結果不正確"

# 測試個案3
  def test_is_substring(string_fixture):
      """測試個案3：測試子字符串檢查功能"""
      assert is_substring("hellopytest", string_fixture), f"{string_fixture} 應該是 'hellopytest' 的子字符串"
